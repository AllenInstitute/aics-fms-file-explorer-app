Versioning and deployment/publishing
====================================

The strategy for versioning and deployment/publishing within this project is complicated by the fact that the three subpackages produce very different artifacts. That is, the `fms-file-explore-core` package produces an NPM library that is published to [npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aics/fms-file-explorer-core); the `fms-file-explorer-electron` produces platform-specific executables for linux, macOS, and Windows; and `fms-file-explorer-web` produces a static website intended to be dumped into an S3 website bucket (or otherwise sit behind a web server).

The following captures the steps of a release of this project:

1. Trigger a project-wide version bump and publish the new version of `fms-file-explorer-core` to `npmjs.org`: https://jenkins.corp.alleninstitute.org/job/desktop-apps/job/fms-file-explorer/job/master/build (select "Version packages in the monorepo and publish @aics/fms-file-explorer-core" for "JOB_TYPE" and whichever semver bump for "VERSION_BUMP_TYPE" makes sense). Underneath the hood, `lerna` is used to bump the versions of each of the subpackges within the repo. Additionally, `lerna` will handle bumping the version of `fms-file-explorer-core` referenced in the `package.json` of `fms-file-explorer-electron` and `fms-file-explorer-web`. Last, using credentials stored in Jenkins, `npm publish` is run _specifically_ within the `fms-file-explorer-core` subpackage.
3. Trigger a build/release of the desktop application: https://jenkins.corp.alleninstitute.org/job/desktop-apps/job/fms-file-explorer/job/master/build (select "Trigger release workflow on Github" for "JOB_TYPE"). Under the hood, a Github action is triggered which will create new, platform-specific builds of `fms-file-explorer-electron`, prepare a draft Github release, and upload the new builds as release artifacts to that release.
