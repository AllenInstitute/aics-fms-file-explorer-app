                            on your selection, and select "Open in... -> ImageJ/Fiji."
                            <p>
                                Alternatively, you can copy and paste (e.g.: ⌘ + C, ⌘ + V) a file path found from the FMS File Explorer into your image viewer of choice. To find the file path for a file,
                                simply select it: the file path will be displayed in the details pane on the right-hand side of the application.

                            containing a row for each file that matched your selection. The columns within the CSV represent all available metadata--expect few rows, if any,
                            to have a value for each and every column. Once downloaded, each row will have a <code>File Path</code> column that points to its permanent location

                    <p>
                        If you're looking around the application trying to figure out how to do something and it just doesn't seem possible, there's a
                        chance that we haven't had the opportunity to implement that feature yet. (Sorting is one example.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To know for certain whether what you're hoping to do isn't possible <em>yet</em> or whether it just isn't obvious,
                        you can ask your team's ambassador to this project, or <a class="link" href="#report-issue">reach out directly to the software engineering team.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p class="banner">
                        If there is a missing feature that would really make this application sing for you, please let us know!

                        Maybe you think some data should be available but you can't find it, or maybe you found a way to crash the application.
                        Maybe you'd be really excited if a particular feature is implemented, or maybe you just want to chat.
                        In any case, it would be our privilege to hear from you--please don't be shy.

                        We're fairly certain you know how to get a hold of the software engineering team (e.g., Slack, email, Zoom, Teams, etc), but here are a few
                        additional channels that are out of the ordinary:
