                            to be on VPN to <em>download</em> the application, just to use it.

                            <strong>N.b.: This application requires access to the public internet to work properly.</strong> If your VPN configuration blocks access to the public
                            internet, you'll notice--among other potential issues--that usages of certain icons are replaced by placeholder boxes. Those boxes are
                            still functional, but without seeing the icon, it may be difficult to know what function the boxes serve!

                            <em>and</em> you have the Isilon mounted on your computer at <code>/allen</code>, you can copy any file path directly from the FMS File Explorer
                            and paste it into your image viewer of choice (Zen, FIJI, AGAVE, etc). To find the file path for a file, simply select it: the file path will be
                            displayed in the details pane on the right-hand side of the application.

                            of files or on a directory within the FMS File Explorer and select <code>Download -> Manifest</code>. This will trigger a download of a CSV file
                            containing a row for each file that matched your selection. The columns within the CSV represent all available metadata--expect few rows, if any,
                            to have a value for each and every column. Once downloaded, each row will have a <code>File Path</code> column that points to its permanent location
                            on the Isilon.

                        If you're looking around the application trying to figure out how to do something and you just can't figure it out, there's a
                        chance that we haven't had the opportunity to implement that feature yet. (Sorting is one example.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To know for certain whether what you're hoping to do isn't possible <em>yet</em> or whether it just isn't obvious,
                        you can ask your team's ambassador, or reach out directly a member of the software engineering team.
